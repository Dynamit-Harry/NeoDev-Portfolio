title: Lego Car Controller
url: https://github.com/Dynamit-Harry/Lego-car-Project-controller
desc: Part two of two for a project where we used a website and MQTT to control motors and servos on a lego car. This part of the project is responsible to recieve commands from the website via an MQTT broker and convert it to movement by controlling a servo to turn as well as a motor for moving.
